a quick and simple working example for many of the cool VAE models out there.

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.6
- PyTorch >= 1.5.0
- Pytorch Lightning >= 1.0.0

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/threewisemonkeys-as/PyTorch-VAE.git
cd PyTorch-VAE
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
